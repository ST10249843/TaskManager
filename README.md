# EasyKanban Java Application

EasyKanban is a desktop-based task management system developed in Java using Swing. It replicates a simplified Kanban board where users can register, log in, create tasks, and interact with them through a GUI. The application supports task creation, categorization by status, search, and reporting â€” with all data persisted in a JSON file.

---

## Overview

EasyKanban allows users to:
- Add and track tasks categorized as "To Do", "In Progress", or "Done".
- View sender and recipient information for tasks.
- Search tasks by ID or recipient number.
- Delete tasks based on their unique task code.
- View a report of completed tasks.

All tasks are saved to and loaded from a `tasks.json` file using the `json-simple` library.
